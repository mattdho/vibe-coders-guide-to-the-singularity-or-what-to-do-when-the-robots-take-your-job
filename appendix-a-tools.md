## Tool Selection Philosophy

### Choose Tools That:
- **Increase your autonomy** rather than creating new dependencies
- **Have export/migration options** to avoid vendor lock-in
- **Align with your values** regarding privacy and business practices
- **Scale with your business** from solo work to team collaboration
- **Have active communities** for learning and troubleshooting

### Avoid Tools That:
- **Lock you in** with proprietary formats or difficult migration
- **Extract excessive value** through high fees or surveillance
- **Create unnecessary complexity** for your current needs
- **Have unclear business models** that might change suddenly
- **Lack documentation** or community support

## Getting Started This Week

1. **Set up one AI writing assistant** (start with free options)
2. **Create accounts on essential platforms** (GitHub, basic hosting)
3. **Choose one web development stack** and complete your first tutorial
4. **Set up basic business infrastructure** (domain, email, simple website)
5. **Join one relevant community** for your chosen technical specialty

The goal isn't to learn every tool immediately. The goal is to build a foundation of technical capabilities and business infrastructure that gives you options when traditional employment becomes unreliable.

Start with the essentials, add tools as you need them, and always prioritize learning over accumulating subscriptions.
