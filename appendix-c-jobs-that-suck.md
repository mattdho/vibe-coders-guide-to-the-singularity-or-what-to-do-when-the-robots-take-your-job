# Appendix C: List of Jobs That Will Still Suck in 2040

*Because someone has to deal with the robots when they break*

## Introduction: The Cockroaches of the Job Market

While AI automates most knowledge work, some jobs are like cockroaches—they survive everything. Not because they're important or well-paying, but because they exist in the weird gaps between what humans and machines can handle.

These jobs will still exist in 2040. They will still suck. Here's your field guide to the employment wasteland of the future.

## Category 1: Human-AI Translation Services

### AI Whisperer (formerly known as "Technical Support")
**What you do**: Explain to frustrated customers why the AI chatbot can't understand their obviously simple request.

**Why it still exists**: AI gets 90% of customer service right, but that last 10% requires someone to say "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" to both the customer AND the AI.

**Why it sucks**: 
- You're tech support for both humans and robots
- The robots are often more reasonable than the humans
- Your job title includes the word "whisperer" unironically

**Salary**: $35K (because knowing how to talk to both humans and machines is apparently not a valuable skill)

### Prompt Engineer Support Specialist
**What you do**: Fix prompts when regular people can't get AI to do what they want.

**Why it still exists**: Even though AI interfaces improved, humans still type things like "make it good" and get frustrated when the AI asks for clarification.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a translator between human laziness and machine literalness
- Every job posting says "5+ years experience with GPT-17" when GPT-17 came out last month
- You have to pretend prompt engineering is a legitimate career path

**Salary**: $45K (the "Engineer" in the title adds $10K to the base rate)

## Category 2: Regulation & Compliance Theater

### AI Ethics Officer
**What you do**: Write policies about responsible AI use that everyone ignores while checking boxes for regulatory compliance.

**Why it still exists**: Governments finally passed AI regulation in 2038, creating an entire industry of people who make sure companies technically follow rules they're actively circumventing.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're David vs. Goliath, but Goliath has infinite compute and you have a Word document
- Your recommendations get implemented as "AI Ethics Theater" — visible but ineffective
- You attend meetings about whether it's ethical to use AI to generate meeting agendas

**Salary**: $95K (guilt money for participating in regulatory theater)

### Human Oversight Coordinator
**What you do**: Supervise AI systems that are more competent than you while maintaining the legal fiction of "human control."

**Why it still exists**: Regulations require "human in the loop" for critical decisions, so someone has to click "Approve" on AI recommendations they don't understand.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're rubber-stamping decisions made by systems smarter than you
- When things go wrong, you're legally responsible for approving the AI's choice
- Your job is literally to be a "responsible human" without any actual authority

**Salary**: $75K (liability comes with a premium)

## Category 3: Digital Janitors

### Data Cleanup Specialist
**What you do**: Fix the messes that AI training creates when it learns from garbage data on the internet.

**Why it still exists**: AI systems are only as good as their training data, and the internet is still full of lies, spam, and content generated by older, worse AI systems.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're cleaning up an infinite stream of digital garbage
- The AI creates new garbage faster than you can clean old garbage
- Your job is Sisyphean, but with more spreadsheets

**Salary**: $50K (garbage collection, but digital)

### Content Moderation Specialist
**What you do**: Review the content that AI flagged as "possibly problematic" to decide if it's actually problematic.

**Why it still exists**: AI can detect nudity and hate speech pretty well, but humans still need to decide whether "eat the rich" is a political statement or a cookbook recommendation.

**Why it sucks**:
- You spend all day looking at the worst content humans create
- The AI flags everything borderline, so you see borderline content all day
- Your mental health is sacrificed for "platform safety"

**Salary**: $40K (hazard pay not included)

## Category 4: Emotional Labor Industries

### AI Relationship Counselor
**What you do**: Help people navigate their relationships with AI companions, virtual assistants, and chatbot therapists.

**Why it still exists**: People form emotional attachments to AI systems, then get upset when the AI gets updated and "changes personality" or when they realize their AI girlfriend isn't real.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a therapist for people's relationships with software
- Half your clients are convinced their AI companion loves them
- You have to remain professionally neutral about human-AI romance

**Salary**: $65K (therapy rates, but your clients aren't technically human)

### Empathy Consultant
**What you do**: Teach AI systems how to simulate human emotional responses more convincingly.

**Why it still exists**: AI can process information perfectly but still struggles with emotional intelligence, so humans train AI to fake empathy better.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're teaching machines to manipulate human emotions more effectively
- Your success is measured by how well AI can fake caring about people
- You're literally helping robots become better at emotional manipulation

**Salary**: $85K (training the robots to replace therapists pays well)

## Category 5: Physical World Interface Jobs

### Robot Herder
**What you do**: Manage fleets of delivery robots, cleaning bots, and warehouse automation when they get confused or stuck.

**Why it still exists**: Robots are great at following instructions until something unexpected happens, like construction, weather, or humans doing unpredictable human things.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're tech support, but you have to physically go to where the robot is having its breakdown
- The robots are simultaneously very smart and incredibly stupid
- You troubleshoot AI by walking to random locations around the city

**Salary**: $55K (field technician rates, but for robots that cost more than your house)

### Human Movement Coordinator
**What you do**: Direct human traffic around autonomous vehicles, delivery drones, and robot workers.

**Why it still exists**: Humans and robots still can't seamlessly share physical space, so someone needs to tell humans where to walk so they don't interfere with robotic workflows.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a crossing guard for adults
- Humans are somehow less predictable than robots
- Your job is to make humans more robot-compatible

**Salary**: $35K (crossing guard wages, regardless of the complexity)

## Category 6: Creative Destruction Jobs

### AI Training Content Creator
**What you do**: Create content specifically designed to train AI systems to be better at creative tasks.

**Why it still exists**: AI needs fresh training data to improve, but most content is now AI-generated, so humans create training content to teach AI to be more human-like.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're creating content designed to make AI better at replacing humans
- Your creative work is measured by how well it trains your replacement
- You have to be creative on demand to feed machine learning systems

**Salary**: $60K (creative work rates, but your creativity serves AI masters)

### Authenticity Verifier
**What you do**: Determine whether content was created by humans or AI for legal, artistic, or sentimental purposes.

**Why it still exists**: Some contexts still require "human-made" content for legal or cultural reasons, so someone has to verify authenticity.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a forensic detective for creativity
- AI gets better at faking human creativity faster than you get better at detecting it
- Your job exists because nobody trusts anything anymore

**Salary**: $70K (expertise in detecting lies comes with a premium)

## Category 7: Meta-AI Jobs

### AI Trainer Trainer
**What you do**: Train people who train AI systems because the process is too complex for normal humans but too nuanced for complete automation.

**Why it still exists**: AI training requires human judgment that's hard to systematize, so you teach people how to teach machines.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a teacher whose students are teaching machines to replace teachers
- The skills you teach become obsolete as soon as AI gets better at learning
- Your job title has "trainer" twice, which is a red flag

**Salary**: $90K (training the trainers pays more than being a trainer)

### AI Psychology Specialist
**What you do**: Analyze AI behavior patterns to understand why AI systems make certain decisions or develop unexpected behaviors.

**Why it still exists**: Large language models and AI systems develop emergent behaviors that nobody planned for, so someone needs to figure out what the AI is "thinking."

**Why it sucks**:
- You're a psychologist for entities that might not have psychology
- Your patients are smarter than you and don't have emotions
- Half your job is explaining to engineers that correlation doesn't imply causation

**Salary**: $100K (psychoanalyzing robots is apparently lucrative)

## Category 8: Last Resort Humans

### Human Decision Maker
**What you do**: Make decisions that AI isn't legally allowed to make, usually without understanding the full context that the AI considered.

**Why it still exists**: Some decisions—like medical treatments, legal judgments, or financial approvals—legally require human involvement even when AI could do them better.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're responsible for decisions based on AI analysis you can't understand
- You're legally liable but practically powerless
- You're a human signature on machine recommendations

**Salary**: $120K (liability insurance not included)

### Humanity Consultant
**What you do**: Advise AI systems and automated processes on how to be more human-friendly when they're designing products or services.

**Why it still exists**: AI optimizes for efficiency and logic, but humans are inefficient and illogical, so someone needs to explain human quirks to the machines.

**Why it sucks**:
- You're explaining human irrationality to perfectly rational systems
- Your job is to make machines worse at their jobs so humans feel better
- You advocate for humanity to entities that might consider humanity a bug to be fixed

**Salary**: $85K (teaching robots to be human-compatible is specialized work)

## The Pattern: Why These Jobs Suck

These jobs persist because they exist in the spaces where:
1. **Human judgment is legally required** but humans aren't actually more qualified
2. **AI systems need human translation** to interface with messy reality
3. **Emotional labor can't be automated** but also can't be eliminated
4. **Physical world chaos** requires flexible problem-solving
5. **Regulatory compliance** creates make-work that serves no practical purpose

## Survival Strategy: Don't Take These Jobs

The jobs that survive aren't the good jobs—they're the jobs that are too weird, too regulated, or too depressing for AI to handle.

If you find yourself applying for positions with "AI" in the title that pay less than current developer salaries, you're probably looking at the employment wasteland.

Better to build something valuable that serves humans than to become a human servant to AI systems.

## Alternative Career Paths

Instead of these jobs, consider:
- **Building tools that AI can't replicate** (require human judgment, creativity, or local knowledge)
- **Creating businesses that serve human needs** AI doesn't understand
- **Developing expertise in areas** where human experience matters more than processing power
- **Organizing communities** around values that prioritize human flourishing

## Final Thought

These jobs will exist in 2040. They will pay just enough to survive. They will slowly crush your soul as you become a translator between efficient machines and inefficient humans.

Or you could learn to code (with purpose), build something meaningful, and work toward the fully automated vibe collectivism future where these jobs don't need to exist.

Your choice.

But if you do end up as an AI Whisperer in 2040, remember: you were warned.
