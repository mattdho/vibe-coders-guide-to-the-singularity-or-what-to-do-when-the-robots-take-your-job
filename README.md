# The Vibe Coders Guide to the Singularity
## (Or What to Do When the Robots Take Your Job)

*A tactical, subversive survival guide for coders, creatives, freelancers, and technologists navigating the AI-driven collapse of traditional jobs, workflows, and industries.*

### What This Is

This isn't another breathless "AI will save us all" manifesto or a doom-and-gloom "robots are coming" panic piece. This is a practical field guide for people who work with their brains and fingers—developers, designers, writers, analysts, and anyone whose job involves thinking and making.

The singularity isn't coming. It's here. Your LinkedIn feed is full of layoff announcements. Your manager is asking about "AI efficiency gains." Your job description now includes "working with AI tools" like that's supposed to make you feel better about being automated out of existence.

### What This Isn't

- Career advice from people who've never been laid off
- "Learn to code" takes from 2012
- Techno-optimist fairy tales about universal basic income
- Academic theories about the future of work

### What You'll Find Here

- Actual tactics for surviving the transition
- Code examples and automation workflows
- Real talk about which jobs are dying and which are evolving
- Strategies for building income streams that don't depend on HR departments
- Cultural analysis that doesn't pretend capitalism is your friend

### The Vibe

Think David Graeber meets The Pragmatic Programmer, with a Python script in one hand and a pink slip in the other. "Vibe coding"—Andrej Karpathy's term for AI-assisted development where you describe what you want while AI handles the implementation—captures part of what we're doing here. But we're taking it further: vibe everything. Vibe your career, vibe your independence, vibe your way out of wage labor entirely.

We're not here to sugarcoat anything, but we're also not here to panic. We're here to adapt, automate, and maybe build something better in the process.
