# Chapter 2: Prompt or Be Prompted

*LLMs as the new interface to labor*

## The $180K Prompt Engineer

In March 2023, Anthropic posted a job listing that broke the internet: "Prompt Engineer - $175K-$335K." Within 48 hours, thousands of English majors were crafting their resumes around their ability to "communicate effectively with AI systems."

By December 2023, those same companies were quietly removing "Prompt Engineer" roles and folding the responsibilities into existing jobs. By March 2024, ChatGPT could write better prompts than most prompt engineers.

Today, in early 2025, job listings for "Prompt Engineer" are mostly from startups trying to hire technical writers for half the salary of actual engineers.

What happened? The same thing that happens to every interface technology: it gets abstracted away until anyone can use it.

## The Interface Pattern

Every new computing paradigm follows the same pattern:

**1970s**: You needed a PhD to use a computer
- Interface: Punch cards and assembly language
- Users: Computer scientists and mathematicians
- Barrier to entry: Extremely high

**1980s**: You needed technical training to use a computer
- Interface: Command line and basic GUIs  
- Users: Engineers and technical professionals
- Barrier to entry: High

**1990s**: You needed computer literacy to use a computer
- Interface: Point-and-click GUIs
- Users: Office workers and early adopters
- Barrier to entry: Medium

**2000s**: You needed basic digital skills to use a computer
- Interface: Web browsers and applications
- Users: Most professionals and many consumers
- Barrier to entry: Low

**2010s**: Anyone could use a computer
- Interface: Touch screens and apps
- Users: Everyone with a smartphone
- Barrier to entry: Nearly zero

**2020s**: AI follows the same pattern
- **2022**: You needed technical knowledge to use AI
- **2023**: You needed prompt engineering skills to use AI effectively
- **2024**: You needed basic AI literacy to stay competitive
- **2025**: Anyone can use AI, but you need AI tactics to stay relevant

The pattern is clear: specialized interface skills become commoditized, then disappear entirely.

## Why Prompt Engineering Isn't a Career

Let's be direct: prompt engineering as a standalone profession was always a temporary market inefficiency. Here's why:

### 1. The Interface Is Improving Faster Than Human Skill

```python
# 2023: Complex prompt engineering required
prompt_2023 = """
You are an expert Python developer with 10+ years of experience.
You follow PEP-8 style guidelines and write comprehensive docstrings.
You prefer functional programming patterns and avoid global state.
You test your code thoroughly and handle edge cases.

Task: Write a function that processes CSV files and returns cleaned data.
Requirements:
- Handle missing values by filling with column means
- Remove rows with more than 50% missing data  
- Convert string dates to datetime objects
- Return as pandas DataFrame
- Include error handling for file reading
- Add type hints and comprehensive docstring

Please think step by step and explain your approach.
"""

# 2025: Simple intent-based prompting
prompt_2025 = "Clean this CSV file and return as DataFrame"
```

The AI got better at understanding intent. The human skill of crafting elaborate prompts became unnecessary.

### 2. The Tools Are Abstracting Away Prompting

Most AI tools now handle prompting automatically:

```python
# Old way: Manual prompt crafting
def old_ai_coding():
    prompt = craft_detailed_prompt(task, context, constraints)
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    return parse_and_validate(response)

# New way: Intent-based interfaces
def new_ai_coding():
    return cursor.generate_code(
        intent="Clean CSV data",
        context=current_file,
        style=team_preferences
    )
```

When Cursor, Replit, and other coding tools handle the prompting automatically, what exactly does a "prompt engineer" do?

### 3. Everyone Is Learning Basic Prompting

By 2025, basic prompt techniques are as common as knowing how to use Google search:

- **Chain of thought**: "Let's think step by step"
- **Few-shot learning**: Providing examples
- **Role assignment**: "You are an expert in..."
- **Output formatting**: "Return as JSON"

These aren't specialized skills anymore. They're baseline digital literacy.

### 4. The Real Skill Is Domain Knowledge

The valuable prompt engineers weren't good at prompting—they were good at their original domains:

- **Legal prompt engineers**: Were already lawyers who understood legal documents
- **Marketing prompt engineers**: Were already marketers who understood campaigns
- **Technical prompt engineers**: Were already developers who understood code

The prompting was just the interface. The value was the domain expertise.

## What "Prompt Engineering" Actually Means Now

In 2025, "prompt engineering" isn't a job title—it's a basic competency, like typing or using email. But within that competency, there are tactical levels:

### Level 1: Basic Prompting (Everyone)
```
Write a function that sorts a list
```

### Level 2: Contextual Prompting (Competent)
```
Write a Python function that sorts a list of dictionaries by a specified key,
handling cases where the key might not exist in some dictionaries
```

### Level 3: Strategic Prompting (Advanced)  
```python
# Multi-step workflow with context management
system_prompt = """
You are a senior Python developer working on a data processing pipeline.
The codebase follows these conventions:
- Use type hints
- Prefer composition over inheritance  
- Handle errors gracefully with custom exceptions
- Include comprehensive docstrings
"""

task_prompt = """
Given this existing codebase context: {current_code}
And these test requirements: {test_specs}
Implement a robust sorting function for our data pipeline.
Consider edge cases and integration with existing error handling.
"""
```

### Level 4: System Prompting (Expert)
Building entire AI-powered workflows that chain multiple models, manage context, and adapt based on results.

Most jobs require Level 2. Some require Level 3. Almost none require Level 4 as a full-time role.

## The Real AI Interface Skills

Instead of "prompt engineering," focus on these more durable skills:

### 1. AI Tool Selection and Orchestration

Knowing which tool to use for which task:

```python
# Strategic tool selection
def solve_coding_problem(complexity, domain):
    if complexity == "simple":
        return use_copilot()  # Fast autocomplete
    elif domain == "frontend":
        return use_v0()  # Visual component generation
    elif complexity == "architecture":
        return use_claude_projects()  # Long context planning
    else:
        return use_cursor()  # Full codebase integration
```

### 2. Context Management

The skill of feeding AI systems the right context:

```python
# Good context management
def get_ai_help():
    context = {
        "current_file": read_file(),
        "related_files": get_dependencies(),
        "team_standards": load_style_guide(),
        "recent_changes": get_git_history(days=7),
        "error_logs": get_recent_errors()
    }
    return ai_assistant.help(task, context)
```

### 3. AI Output Validation

Knowing how to verify and improve AI-generated work:

```python
# AI output validation pipeline
def validate_ai_code(generated_code):
    checks = [
        run_static_analysis(generated_code),
        check_security_vulnerabilities(generated_code),
        verify_performance_requirements(generated_code),
        test_edge_cases(generated_code),
        validate_team_standards(generated_code)
    ]
    return all(checks)
```

### 4. Human-AI Workflow Design

Creating processes where humans and AI collaborate effectively:

```python
# Human-AI workflow
def collaborative_development():
    # AI generates initial implementation
    draft = ai.generate_code(requirements)
    
    # Human reviews and refines
    reviewed = human.review(draft, business_context)
    
    # AI optimizes based on feedback
    optimized = ai.refactor(reviewed, performance_goals)
    
    # Human validates final result
    return human.approve(optimized)
```

## The Commoditization Timeline

Here's how AI interface skills are becoming commoditized:

### 2023-2024: The Prompt Engineering Gold Rush
- Companies hire dedicated prompt engineers
- "Prompt engineering" becomes a course topic
- People build careers around crafting prompts

### 2024-2025: Tool Integration Phase  
- AI tools build better interfaces
- Prompting becomes semi-automated
- Focus shifts to tool orchestration

### 2025-2026: Abstraction Phase
- Most prompting happens automatically
- Focus shifts to workflow design
- AI-human collaboration becomes the skill

### 2026+: Post-Interface Phase
- AI understands intent without explicit prompting
- Focus shifts to AI strategy and governance
- The interface disappears entirely

## The Strategic Mistake Everyone Is Making

The biggest mistake professionals are making is treating AI prompting like a career moat instead of a temporary tactical advantage.

**Wrong approach:** "I'm going to become a prompt engineering expert"
**Right approach:** "I'm going to use AI to become better at my actual expertise"

Here's the difference:

### Prompt Engineer Mindset (Temporary)
```python
# Focus on prompting technique
prompt = """
Acting as an expert {domain} professional with {years} experience,
please analyze {data} and provide {output_format} response
considering {constraints} and following {methodology}.
"""
```

### Domain Expert + AI Mindset (Durable)
```python
# Focus on domain insight + AI amplification
def analyze_market_data():
    # Use domain knowledge to frame the problem
    key_metrics = identify_critical_business_metrics()
    
    # Use AI to process data at scale
    analysis = ai.analyze(market_data, focus=key_metrics)
    
    # Use human judgment to interpret results
    insights = apply_business_context(analysis)
    
    # Use AI to communicate findings
    report = ai.format_report(insights, audience=stakeholders)
    
    return human_validated_recommendations(report)
```

The first approach becomes obsolete when AI interfaces improve. The second approach becomes more valuable as AI gets better.

## What This Means for Your Career

If you're currently positioning yourself as a "prompt engineer," pivot immediately. Here's how:

### 1. Identify Your Actual Domain
What did you do before AI? That's your real expertise:
- Marketing professional who uses AI → Marketing strategist
- Developer who uses AI → Software architect  
- Writer who uses AI → Content strategist
- Analyst who uses AI → Business intelligence specialist

### 2. Become an AI-Amplified Domain Expert
Instead of being a generalist who prompts AI, become a specialist who uses AI to be better at your specialty:

```python
# Bad: Generic AI prompter
skills = ["prompt engineering", "AI tools", "LLM optimization"]

# Good: Domain expert + AI
skills = ["financial modeling", "market analysis", "AI-assisted research", 
         "automated reporting", "data-driven strategy"]
```

### 3. Build AI-Native Workflows in Your Domain
Create systems that combine your expertise with AI capabilities:

```python
# Example: AI-native financial analysis
def financial_analysis_workflow():
    # Human: Define analysis framework
    framework = design_analysis_framework()
    
    # AI: Process large datasets
    processed_data = ai.analyze_financial_data(raw_data, framework)
    
    # Human: Interpret results with business context
    insights = interpret_with_market_knowledge(processed_data)
    
    # AI: Generate client-ready materials
    deliverables = ai.create_presentation(insights, client_preferences)
    
    # Human: Quality assurance and relationship management
    return finalize_and_deliver(deliverables)
```

## The Practical Reality: You Still Need to Prompt

Even though prompting isn't a career, you still need to be good at it for survival. Here are the tactical skills that matter:

### Essential Prompting Tactics

**1. Context Compression**
```python
# Instead of overwhelming the AI with everything
bad_prompt = f"""
Here's our entire codebase: {100_files}
Here's our complete documentation: {docs}
Here's our full project history: {git_log}
Now help me fix this bug: {small_issue}
"""

# Provide focused, relevant context
good_prompt = f"""
Bug: {specific_issue}
Relevant code: {affected_function}
Recent changes: {last_3_commits}
Error message: {actual_error}
Expected behavior: {what_should_happen}
"""
```

**2. Iterative Refinement**
```python
# Don't expect perfect results immediately
def iterative_prompting():
    result = ai.generate(initial_prompt)
    
    while not satisfactory(result):
        feedback = analyze_issues(result)
        refined_prompt = improve_prompt(initial_prompt, feedback)
        result = ai.generate(refined_prompt)
    
    return result
```

**3. Output Validation**
```python
# Always validate AI output
def validated_ai_work():
    output = ai.generate(task)
    
    validation_checks = [
        verify_accuracy(output),
        check_completeness(output),
        validate_style(output),
        test_functionality(output)
    ]
    
    if all(validation_checks):
        return output
    else:
        return refine_and_retry(task, output)
```

## Your Immediate Action Plan

1. **Stop calling yourself a prompt engineer.** Update your LinkedIn, resume, and professional identity to reflect your actual domain expertise + AI augmentation.

2. **Audit your current AI usage.** Are you using AI as a crutch for lack of domain knowledge, or as a multiplier for existing expertise?

3. **Develop domain-specific AI workflows.** Create repeatable processes that combine your expertise with AI capabilities.

4. **Learn tactical prompting skills.** You need Level 2-3 prompting competency, but don't make it your primary value proposition.

5. **Build AI-native projects.** Create work that demonstrates your domain expertise amplified by AI, not your ability to prompt AI.

The future doesn't belong to prompt engineers. It belongs to domain experts who can orchestrate AI to achieve outcomes that neither humans nor AI could accomplish alone.

The question isn't whether you can write good prompts. The question is whether you can use AI to create value in your actual area of expertise.
